\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:concl}
	This page would typically contain the optional conclusion for the report. If you have read the introduction, coding in \LaTeX\space should not seem as daunting as originally thought! A majority of the commands are relatively straightforward, and the more complex formatting can be referenced by viewing the code for Chapters \ref{ch:usethese}, \ref{ch:learnword}, and \ref{ch:donotuse} and cross-referencing the output PDF to visualize what each command does. Good luck coding!
