AADL motivations

Need for mechanizing AADL

- unambiguous definition of AADL core rulesas dedicable propositions.

- definition of AADL semantics through the definition of AADL building blocks

\section{Motivations}

We restrict our scope to AADL instance models. XXX. The mechanization follows the following steps:

In chapter \ref{chap::aadl_mecha}, we define the structure of an AADL instance model. From the definition of a component instance and its constituent, we build a collection of Coq helper functions that help manipulating instance models. Then, we define several legality rules and demonstrate they are all decidable.

\textit{To be done:
\begin{itemize}
    \item implement more legality rules, ideally until we cover them all. Many are easy to translate thanks to Coq functional programming.
    \item prove master theorem $\# 2$ on component hierarchy
\end{itemize}
}

In chapter XXX, we extend the previous definitions and add models of the execution semantics for each component category. Then, we define the semanics of a composition of models.

In chapter XXX,
