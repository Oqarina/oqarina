% Foreword goes in here
\begin{foreword}
	This is where the optional foreword would go. Example: This guidebook summarizes the procedures followed by the SEI for research reports written in \LaTeXe. This manual also is intended to guide writers in the elements and structure generally contained in a report as well as to provide a reference to the appropriate style manuals and other writing resources. This document is not meant to supplant, but rather to supplement department recommendations and procedures.
	
	Remember, uncomment the include statement in the main file if you wish to include the contents of this file in the final report.
