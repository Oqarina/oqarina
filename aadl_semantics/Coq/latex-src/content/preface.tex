\begin{preface}
	This page would typically contain the optional preface for the report. A preface is an introduction to a book or other literary work written by the work's author(s). An introductory essay written by a different person is a foreword and precedes an author's preface. The preface often closes with acknowledgments of those who assisted in the literary work. A preface generally covers the background of how the report came into being, or how the idea for the report was developed; this is often followed by thanks and acknowledgments to people who were helpful to the author(s) during the time of writing.
