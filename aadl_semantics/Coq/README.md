# AADL/Coq

This folder is a very preliminary attempt at formalizing some aspects of AADL using Coq.

## Installation

This demo has been tested using Coq version 8.12.1 and VSCoq.

## Usage

You may either
- just run from a makefile or
- play with the Coq files from VSCode. In this case, make sure the Coq directory is the only one in your workspace. Then from the terminal, run

```make build_makefile ; make compile ```

## Suggested reading

Many books exist for Coq,
