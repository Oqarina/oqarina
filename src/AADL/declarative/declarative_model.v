Declarative model
=================

In the previous chapter, we introduced a generic component model that matches the concepts of AADL component type, implementation and instances. In this chapter. we show how to specialize this model to support the AADL declarative model

Note: the following concepts of AADL are excluded: arrays, modes, flows.

In this chapter, we refine an AADL generic component into either a component type or a component implementation. We then introduce the concept of AADL packages as a collection of components, and AADL model has a collection of packages.

AADL Component Type

* An AADL component type is a well-formed generic AADL component without subcomponents and connections.
