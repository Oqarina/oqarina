A central feature of our development is a set of axioms for superdense time. The sufficiency of these axioms is demonstrated by using them to prove that a general model of a discrete event simulation procedure, expressed in terms of a mathematical system, constitutes a state transition function. Several forms of superdense time, both known and novel, are shown to satisfy the axioms.},

We show how a contract framework can be built in a generic way on top of any specification theory which supports composition and specification refinement. Our contract framework lifts refinement to the level of contracts and proposes a notion of contract composition on the basis of dominating contracts. Contract composition satisfies a universal property and can be constructively defined if the underlying specification theory is complete, i.e. it offers operators for quotienting and conjoining specifications. We illustrate our generic construction of contracts by moving a specification theory for modal transition systems to contracts and we show that a (previously proposed) trace-based contract theory is an instance of our framework.},

  abstract = {An automatic synthesis problem is often characterized by an overall goal or specification to be satisfied, the set of all possible outcomes, called the design space, and an algorithm for the automatic selection of one or more members from the design space that are provably guaranteed to satisfy the overall specification. A key challenge in automatic synthesis is the complexity of the design space. In this paper, we introduce a formal model, termed hierarchical contract nets, and a framework for the efficient automatic synthesis of hierarchical contract nets, based on a library of refinement relations between contracts and contract nets. We show, via the application of automatic synthesis of assurances cases, that hierarchical contract-based synthesis can mitigate the design space complexity problem. We also show that the approach can bring both the benefits of automating the creation of assurance cases and ensuring that the knowledge from the argumentation experts is captured and reflected in the synthesized assurance cases.},

        abstract = {DEVS is a popular formalism for modelling complex dynamic systems using a discrete-event abstraction. At this abstraction level, a timed sequence ofpertinent "events" input to a system (or internal, in the case of timeouts) cause instantaneous changes to the state of the system. Between events, the state does not change, resulting in a a piecewise constant state trajectory. Main advantages of DEVS are its rigorous formal definition, and its support for modular composition. This chapter introduces the Classic DEVS formalism in a bottom-up fashion, using a simple traffic light example. The syntax and operational semantics of Atomic (i.e., non-hierarchical) models are intruced first. The semantics of Coupled (hierarchical) models is then given by translation into Atomic DEVS models. As this formal "flattening" is not efficient, a modular abstract simulator which operates directly on the coupled model is also presented. This is the common basis for subsequent efficient implementations. We continue to actual applications of DEVS modelling and simulation, as seen in performance analysis for queueing systems. Finally, we present some of the shortcomings in the Classic DEVS formalism, and show solutions to them in the form of variants of the original formalism.},

Several frameworks are based on actors, which provide a more disciplined model for concurrency than threads. The interactions between actors, however, if not constrained, admit nondeterminism. As a consequence, actor programs may exhibit unintended behaviors and are less amenable to rigorous testing. We show that nondeterminism can be handled in a number of ways, surveying dataflow dialects, process networks, synchronous-reactive models, and discrete-event models. These existing approaches, however, tend to require centralized control, pose challenges to modular system design, or introduce a single point of failure. We describe “reactors,” a new coordination model that combines ideas from several of these approaches to enable determinism while preserving much of the style of actors. Reactors promote modularity and allow for distributed execution. By using a logical model of time that can be associated with physical time, reactors also provide control over timing. Reactors also expose parallelism that can be exploited on multicore machines and in distributed configurations without compromising determinacy.},

              is an open-source and extensible modelling and simulation framework. It offers heterogeneous modeling capabilities by allowing different models of computation, both untimed and timed, to be composed hierarchically in an arbitrary fashion. This paper proposes a formal semantics for Ptolemy that is modular in the sense that atomic actors and their compositions are treated in a unified way. In particular, all actors conform to an executable interface that contains four functions: fire (produce outputs given current state and inputs); postfire (update state instantaneously); deadline (how much time the actor is willing to let elapse); and time-update (update the state with the passage of time). Composite actors are obtained using composition operators that in Ptolemy are called directors. Different directors realise different models of computation. In this paper, we formally define the directors for the following models of computation: synchronous- reactive, discrete event, continuous time, process networks and modal models.},

The paper has two broad aims: Firstly to provide a guide to the fundamental results for these real-time scheduling algorithms. Secondly to provide a brief review of extensions aimed at (i) limiting the effects and overheads of pre-emption and (ii) accounting for the effects of pre-emptions; specifically cache related pre-emption delays. The paper also briefly looks back at success stories in real-time scheduling, and forwards at the current hot topics in this research area.},

  abstract     = {Proof assistants like Coq, Lean, or HOL4 rely heavily on
                  stateful meta-programs called scripts to assemble
                  proofs. Unlike pen-and-paper proofs, proof scripts only
                  describe the steps to take (induct on x, apply a theorem, …),
                  not the states that these steps lead to; as a result, plain
                  proof scripts are essentially incomprehensible without the
                  assistance of an interactive user interface able to run the
                  script and show the corresponding proof states. Until now, the
                  standard process to communicate a proof without forcing
                  readers to execute its script was to manually copy-paste
                  intermediate proof states into the script, as source code
                  comments — a tedious and error-prone exercise. Additional
                  prose (such as for a book or tutorial) was likewise embedded
                  in comments, preserving executability at the cost of a
                  mediocre text-editing experience. This paper describes a new
                  approach to the development and dissemination of literate
                  proof scripts, with a focus on the Coq proof
                  assistant. Specifically, we describe two contributions: a
                  compiler that interleaves Coq’s output with the original proof
                  script to produce interactive webpages that are complete,
                  self-contained presentations of Coq proofs; and a new literate
                  programming toolkit that allows authors to switch seamlessly
                  between prose- and code-oriented views of the same sources, by
                  translating back and forth between reStructuredText documents
                  and literate Coq source files. In combination, these tools
                  offer a new way to write, communicate, and preserve proofs,
                  combining the flexibility of procedural proof scripts and the
                  intelligibility of declarative proofs.},
