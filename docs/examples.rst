In this part, we provide some case studies using Oqarina to model and analyze models.

* AADL
    * :doc:`coq/AADL__full_example.v` introduces Oqarina and some of its key concepts.

    * :doc:`coq/3rd-party__aadl2prosa.v` shows how to use Oqarina and PROSA to map an AADL model to a PROSA task set and conclude on the schedulability of a model.

* Fault Trees
    * :doc:`coq/FaultTrees__FaultTrees_Examples.v` illustrates how to analyze fault trees.
