# Oqarina examples

This folder has a couple of examples illustrating the usage of Oqarina

* `AADL`: examples of AADL models in Coq and some manipulation
* `DEVS`: DEVS models and their simulation in Coq
* `3rd-party`: examples that use external libraries. Note they are not build as part of Oqarina and make break. See each example for details.
